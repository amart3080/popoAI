I will try to understand the fundamentals of artificial intelligence and machine learning to grasp an understanding of how it learns and studies data that it is given. I will attempt to create somewhat of an algorithm; basically trying to create an AI of my own. This will obviously be difficult and I will have to work on this out of school to achieve a fully functioning AI. 
To do this, I will be using a popular software used worldwide called “Visual Studio Code”. This is where I will write and store all the code along with an extension where it shall create somewhat of a template for me to “tamper” with. YouTube tutorials will be guiding me throughout this project to help me have a better understanding on what AI and machine learning work and  how artificial intelligence functions.
